	One of the first projects I was given by Unanimis was to automate the stat delivery summarisation process. The point of this process
	was to take raw stats delivery and filter out duplicated or irrelevant data (such as when two datasources record the same impression).

	The process had to handle tables with millions of rows, and was initially intended to be triggered daily. This was later enhanced to 
	trigger against any delivery stat changes.

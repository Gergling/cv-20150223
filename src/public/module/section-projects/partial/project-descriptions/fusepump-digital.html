While in the FusePump Digital team I built two modal popup windows for Nestle to display their products with.

These were hosted from Amazon S3 and Cloudfront.

Nestle sites would implement an integration code and attach a button id for users to open the window.

The window showed an assortment of products based on the integration code.

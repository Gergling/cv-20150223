	The project code-named <a href="http://yoa-erp-dev.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">"Workspace"</a> was for YOA Insurance to organise and analyse
	insurance policies and generate leads for further business. The back-end was developed in C# by a 3rd-party company, while I helped develop the 
	front-end as a single-page-app using angularjs.

	The delivery stats downloader was part of the delivery automation process. While much of the delivery was already being 
	downloaded by querying the database of the OpenX adserver, there were plans to move many of our campaigns to the 
	now google-owned DFP and use their API. This part of the process would run on a daily basis before the summarisation 
	part of the process would run.
